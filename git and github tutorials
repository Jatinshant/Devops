Git: Git is a distributed version control system that helps us to track changes in code. It is popular,free and open source, fast and scalable.

Github: Github is a website that allows developers to store and manage their code using git.
Github account
Create a new repository
make our first commit

README.md file: In READEME.md file we give the discription about our project.(md=> markdown)

Configuration git:  (gitconfig --global user.name"MY NAME"
                    gitconfig --global user.email"abc@gmail.com"
                    git config --list)

init: It is used to create a new git repo.
(git init)
(git remote add origin <link>)
(git remote -v) to verify remote

Clone and Status: 
clone:- cloning a repository from remote server to local machine.
(git clone <some link>)

status: display the state of a file.
(git status)

Untracked: New file that git doesn't yet track.

Modified: chnaged.

Staged: file is ready for committed.

Unmodified: unchanged.

Add and Commit: 
add: adds new or changed files in your working directory to the git staging area.
(git add <file name>)

for stage multiple file
(git add.)

For unstage file:  git restore --staged filename

commit: it is the record of change
(git commit -m "some message")

push: upload local repo content to remote repo.
(git push origin main)

Work Flow:  github-repo ---> clone ---> changes ---> add ---> commit ---> push

Git Branches: In github, branches refers to separate line of development with in a git repository.

branch commands:
git branch (to check branch)
git branch -M main (to rename branch)
git checkout <brnach name> (to navigate)
git checkout -b <new branch name> (to create new branch)
git branch -d <branch name> (to delete branch)

Merging code: 
way-1: git diff <branch name> (to compare commits, branches, files and more)
       git merge <branch name> (to merge 2 branches)

way-2: Create a PR(pull request)

pull request: It lets you tell about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on github.

pull command: Used to fetch and download content from a repo and immediatly update the local repo to match that content.
(git pull origin main)

Resolving merge conflicts: An event that take place when git is unable to automatically resolve difference in code between two commmits.

# git log command is use to find our commits or commit hash 

Undoing Changes: 
Case-1: staged chnages
(git reset <filename>)
(git reset)

Case-2: Commited changes for one commit.
(git reset HEAD~1)

Case-3: Commited chnages for many commits.
(git reset <commit hash>) 
(git reset --hard <commit hash>)

Fork: A fork is a new repository that shares code and visibility settings with the original upstream repository.
fork is a rough copy.
